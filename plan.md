# PDF-o-matic Project Plan âœ…

## Current Goal
Build a full-stack PDF manipulation application with Material Design 3 UI, Nord palette theming, and comprehensive PDF tools.

---

## Phase 1: Core UI Framework and Theme System âœ…
**Goal**: Establish the foundational UI structure with Material Design 3 principles, Nord palette theming (dark/light mode), and navigation framework.

- [x] Set up Material Design 3 component system with elevation levels (0dp-12dp)
- [x] Implement Nord palette color scheme for both dark and light modes
- [x] Create theme toggle functionality with state management
- [x] Build main layout structure (header with theme toggle, main content area)
- [x] Design and implement tool selection cards with titles and descriptions
- [x] Add navigation and responsive layout structure

**Components**: Theme provider, layout shell, navigation header, tool cards grid

---

## Phase 2: PDF Tool Cards and File Upload System âœ…
**Goal**: Create interactive tool cards for all PDF operations and implement secure file upload with validation.

- [x] Make tool cards clickable and navigate to individual tool pages
- [x] Create individual tool pages for each PDF operation (Split, Merge, Compress, PDF to Images, Extract, Rotate)
- [x] Implement file upload component with drag-and-drop support using rx.upload
- [x] Add PDF file validation (check file type and validity using pypdf)
- [x] Create multi-file upload support for merge functionality
- [x] Build upload progress indicators and error handling
- [x] Design consistent tool page layouts with back navigation

**Components**: ToolCard with navigation, individual tool pages, FileUploader, validation logic, progress indicators

---

## Phase 3: PDF Processing Backend and Download System âœ…
**Goal**: Implement actual PDF manipulation operations using pypdf, temporary file management, and result delivery with automatic cleanup.

- [x] Implement Split PDF functionality (split by page ranges or individual pages)
- [x] Implement Merge PDF functionality (combine multiple PDFs)
- [x] Implement Compress PDF functionality (optimize file size)
- [x] Implement PDF to Images conversion with ZIP packaging
- [x] Implement Extract Pages and Rotate Pages tools
- [x] Create temporary file storage with automatic cleanup after download
- [x] Build download system for processed files
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback for processing operations

**Components**: PDF processing service, file management system, download handlers, cleanup utilities
